understand how this works
 

run these scripts in sequence given 

1 . generates 4 csv files == contracts, vendors , payments , avg market price


2. script for feature engineering contract awards - has func definition keep it in same folder

3. same - script for feature engineering payment frauds - func def

4. again the function definition and how to call the combined feature eng = gives two enhanced csv files after feature eng _ contracts and payments

5. example run - it generates  the enhanced files after calling combined func - creates about 122 columns dont use it yet

6. cleans the dataset removes a few useless columns _ remains with about 80 columns all can be used for different purpose

use the dataset created by 6. script to perform further command the name

use this dataset named ------contracts_cleaned-------
Use 'contracts_cleaned.csv' for your EDA and ML modeling.
It contains 88 columns (down from 122).

7 and 8 are for analyzing the dataset row and column wise
first run 7 then run 8


where to go from here?
perform EDA for visualization and perform normalization before going into model

use the contracts_cleaned data
